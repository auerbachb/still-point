# pr-issue-ref.sh — Extract the linked issue number(s) from a PR body.
#
# Scans the PR body for any of GitHub's nine supported issue-closing keywords
# (`close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`,
# `resolved` — case-insensitive, optional whitespace between keyword and `#`)
# and prints the first matching issue number on stdout. Prints nothing when
# no match is found.
#
# With --all, prints every closing reference (one per line, deduplicated) and
# matches both the bare `#N` and the cross-repo `owner/repo#N` forms.
#
# USAGE:
#   pr-issue-ref.sh <pr_number>
#   pr-issue-ref.sh --all <pr_number>
#   pr-issue-ref.sh --help | -h
#
# OUTPUT:
#   Default: first bare-#N issue number on stdout (byte-identical to prior behavior).
#   --all:   every issue number, one per line, sorted and deduplicated.
#            Both the bare `#N` and `owner/repo#N` forms are matched.
#            Only the numeric portion is printed in both cases.
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0    issue reference found (number(s) on stdout)
#   1    no issue reference found (stdout empty)
#   2    usage error (missing/invalid args, unknown flag)
#   3    PR not found
#   4    gh / GitHub API error
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - gh (authenticated)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   pr-issue-ref.sh 290         # → "271" (or empty if no link)
#   ISSUE=$(pr-issue-ref.sh "$PR" || true)
#   pr-issue-ref.sh --all 290   # → one issue number per line (e.g. "271\n345")

Usage: pr-issue-ref.sh [--all] <pr_number>

Extract linked issue number(s) from a PR body. Matches any of GitHub's nine
supported closing keywords — `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`,
`fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved` (case-insensitive, optional
whitespace between keyword and `#`).

Default: prints the first bare `#N` issue number on stdout.
--all:   prints every closing reference (one per line, sorted, deduplicated).
         Matches both the bare `#N` and the `owner/repo#N` cross-repo forms.
         Only the numeric portion is emitted in both cases.
         Existing callers (wrap, standup, admin-merge.sh) use the default mode —
         their output is byte-identical to the behavior before this flag existed.

Exit codes:
  0  issue reference found (number(s) on stdout)
  1  no issue reference found (stdout empty)
  2  usage error
  3  PR not found
  4  gh / GitHub API error
