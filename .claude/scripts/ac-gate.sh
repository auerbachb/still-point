# ac-gate.sh — CI gate: fail a PR that has unchecked acceptance-criteria boxes.
#
# Reads the PR body and applies a two-stage check:
#
#   Stage 1 — unchecked boxes in scope
#     Scans the `## Acceptance Criteria` and `## Test plan` / `## Test Plan`
#     sections (case-insensitive, matching the ac-checkboxes.sh convention).
#     Any unchecked `- [ ]` outside the exemption section is a hard failure.
#     Near-miss headings (case-insensitive match to "post-merge verification"
#     but wrong case) are NOT treated as exemption regions — their unchecked
#     boxes are in-scope failures, not invisible.
#
#   Stage 2 — exemption region (`## Post-merge verification`)
#     The heading must match EXACTLY (spelling and case). A differently-cased
#     or misspelled heading is not treated as an exemption region.
#     Each Post-merge verification section is validated independently.
#     Unchecked boxes inside the exemption section pass only when all three
#     ordered checks succeed:
#       1. A `Tracking issue: #N` line exists inside the section.
#       2. Issue #N is NOT one of the issues this PR closes
#          (the PR #588 self-referential case — the tracking issue closes with
#          the PR and the deferred work is sealed inside a closed issue).
#       3. Issue #N is OPEN (not CLOSED).
#     A `Tracking issue:` line outside the section grants no exemption.
#
# A PR with no unchecked boxes in scope, or with an empty body, passes.
#
# USAGE:
#   ac-gate.sh <pr_number>
#   ac-gate.sh --help | -h
#
# OUTPUT:
#   Single status line on stdout: "AC gate: PASS" or failure detail on stderr.
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0    gate passed (no unchecked in-scope boxes, or exemption checks passed)
#   1    unchecked box outside Post-merge verification section
#   2    usage error (missing/invalid args, unknown flag)
#   3    PR not found
#   4    gh / GitHub API error, or pr-issue-ref.sh not found
#   5    exemption section has no Tracking issue: #N line
#   6    tracking issue is one this PR closes (self-referential — PR #588 case)
#   7    tracking issue is CLOSED
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - gh (authenticated)
#   - pr-issue-ref.sh (sibling script; resolved from same directory)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   ac-gate.sh 1234    # exits 0 (pass) or non-zero (fail, message on stderr)

Gate a PR on unchecked acceptance-criteria boxes. Scans the Acceptance
Criteria and Test Plan sections for unchecked `- [ ]` items. Unchecked
items under `## Post-merge verification` (exact heading) may be deferred
when a valid open tracking issue is named inside the section.

Exit codes:
